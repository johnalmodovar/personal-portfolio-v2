            Before I became a software engineer, I pursued a career in Marketing - until a close friend of mine encouraged me to making a
            switch to the tech industry. He believed I had the skills needed to be successful in this field, and I would enjoy it because I
            have an inherent passion for tech and computers. Having built PCs for myself and others, I started to believe in his words and decided
            to apply what I know about PC building to software development. I began with learning JavaScript and the fundamentals of coding, and the more
            I immersed myself into the world of coding, the more I realized this is truly the career I wanted to pursue.

            Fast forward to the present, I've graduated from Rithm School's full-stack engineering program, and I've transformed from a marketing analyst
            into a software engineer. During this time, I've learned that I love to build applications that everybody admires, and had the privilege to work
            and learn from amazing engineers, and have a taste of what it's like to build and contribute to innovative applications.

            Currently, I am looking for job opportunities and looking forward to contribute to the tech industry - building innovative applications, websites,
            and other cutting-edge projects.
